Have you ever used Single Sign On (SSO) to log into other services or apps? You are likely familiar with using Google or Facebook to SSO into other accounts or even use Okta or Microsoft at work. This talk will provide an introduction to OpenID Connect, a common authentication protocol used for SSO. Once you are familiar with OpenID, we will cover some web application security bugs that can occur when using SSO with some real world examples. This is a great chance to deep dive into a technology we all use everyday and hear about some of the security issues that can arise. This talk does not assume any web hacking knowledge, we will guide you along the way. You'll then be able to look for these bugs yourself!


##Key takeaways:
* An OIDC & OAuth walkthrough: What is OpenID and how does it relate to OAuth? What does an "OAuth" dance entail?
* A brief history of OAuth bugs: Token stealing through redirects; Client impersonation; Insecure flows and more...
* Real word bugs: The 2022 OWASP top bug - OAuth dirty dancing
